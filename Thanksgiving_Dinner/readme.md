## What to Eat for Thanksgiving Dinner? 
In this project I analyze data on Thanksgiving dinner in the US. The dataset came from FiveThirtyEight and is available at https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/tree/master/thanksgiving-2015.
The dataset has 65 columns, and 1058 rows. For analysis, I converted income and age ranges into integer values and create two additional columns.

One assumption analyzed is that responders with lower income are young and will be more likely to travel to celebrate Thanksgiving with their parents. However, the analysis does not show strong correlation between the Thanksgiving travel duration/distance and income.

One thing confirmed by analysis is that younger people are more likely to celebrate the Thanksgiving with their friends or attending a Friendsgiving.
