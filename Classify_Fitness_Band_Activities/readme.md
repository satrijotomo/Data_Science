## Classify Fitness Band Activities with Machine Learning

The Human Activity Recognition database was built from the recordings of 30 study participants performing activities of daily living (ADL) while carrying a waist-mounted smartphone with embedded inertial sensors. The objective is to classify activities into one of the six activities performed.Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. 

The data analsysis is intended to search for the best classifier model that can predict the activity based on the predicting variable values. The train and test dataset are of the same size.
